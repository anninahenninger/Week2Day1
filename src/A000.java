/**
 * Create a class Person
 *
 *     As given through the live coding, with givenName and famillyName properties and corresponding get/set methods.
 *
 *     Create method getFullName() and call it on several Person objects. Improve your initial printing method to get
 *     some nice table-like formatting.
 *
 *     INTERMEDIATE: Improve this implementation! Learn in Internet about the String method toUpperCase( )
 *     and improve your getFullName, so it prints the person name in Format Givenname FAMILYNAME (like John DOE)
